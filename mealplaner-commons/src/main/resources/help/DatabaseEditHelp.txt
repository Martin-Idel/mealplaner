The Meal panel

The second available panel is a panel organising the meal database. Here, you can easily add meals, edit meals and delete meals that you don't want anymore. 

Note: Changing anything requires saving if you want to keep the database. Otherwise, changes will be discarded when closing the application.

Every meal has a few aspects that need to be entered:
- The cooking time: The approximate preparation time (not including waiting time) for the dish, in order to give you the opportunity to plan quick dinners when necessary.
- The utensil: Sometimes, you may want to cook a casserole, because it can be prepared in advance. At other times, you just want to do a quick dish in a pan, which is however not possible when you have a large group of people for dinner. Enter the main utensil to take advantage of that.
- The course type: Most of your meals will be a main dish, but occasionally, you may also want to cook several meals at once.
- The cooking preference: Especially when you have a family with children, they'll have strong opinions about your meals! In that case, you may want to cook some meals more often, while some meals are reserved for special occasions.
- The side dish: While theoretically this could be deduced from the recipe, since you don't have to enter any recipe at all if you don't plan to use the shopping list functionality, it is mandatory to also repeat the main side dish here - this is then used to make sure that you won't have pasta all the time (even if your children would like that).
- A comment: Add any information that you want to record.

In addition, you can also enter a recipe. Recipes usually come with information about how many portions you can expect from a meal, but often, these amounts do not correspond to the actual amount you need for your family. The meal planer is a great way to keep and change recipes. The recipes can then be used to automatically generate shopping lists.
For any recipe, you can choose the corresponding ingredients, which come with the measure of your choice.
